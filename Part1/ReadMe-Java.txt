A sample program to read and display an image in JavaFX panels. By default, this program will read in the first frame of a given .rgb video file.


Unzip the folder to where you want.
To run the code from command line, first compile with:

>> javac ImageDisplay.java

and then, you can run it to take in two parameters "pathToRGBVideo" and "n":

>> java ImageDisplay pathToRGBVideo n

where the parameter "n" is a "dummy" parameter used to give an additional example of command line args in Java.
